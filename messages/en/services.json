      {
        "question": "How often should security checks be done?",
        "answer": "Full audit — once a year or after major changes. Pentest — at least annually, preferably every 6 months. Automated scanning — weekly. For critical systems, we recommend a Bug Bounty program."

      {
        "question": "Won't the pentest break our production?",

        "question": "What if you find a critical vulnerability?",
