      { "question": "How much do your services cost?", "answer": "Cost depends on project complexity. A small Telegram bot starts from 3,000 CHF, website from 8,000 CHF, complex platform from 30,000 CHF. We provide exact estimate after discussing requirements. First consultation is free." },
      { "question": "How long does development take?", "answer": "MVP is usually ready in 4-8 weeks. Full product — 2-4 months. Complex enterprise solutions — 6-12 months. We work Agile with weekly demos, so you see progress at every stage." },
      { "question": "Do you work with clients outside Switzerland?", "answer": "Yes, 40% of our clients are from other countries: Germany, Austria, CIS countries. We work remotely, communicate in Russian, English and German. CET timezone is convenient for Europe." },
      { "question": "What if I don't like the project?", "answer": "We work on a milestone model: you pay for stages as they are completed and approved. If something is wrong at any stage — we redo it at our expense until full approval." },
      { "question": "Do you provide support after launch?", "answer": "Yes, lifetime support is included in every project. This is not marketing — we really answer questions and help with minor improvements. For major changes we discuss separately." },
      { "question": "Can I start with a small project?", "answer": "Of course. Many clients start with MVP or pilot project to evaluate work quality. 80% of them return with larger tasks." },
      { "question": "How do you ensure data security?", "answer": "We work according to ISO 27001 and OWASP standards. All projects undergo security review. If necessary, we involve certified partners for penetration testing. GDPR and Swiss DPA compliant." },
      { "question": "What does technical documentation include?", "answer": "Full package: architecture documentation, API reference, developer guides, deployment and maintenance instructions. Your team will be able to maintain the system independently." }
